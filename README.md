This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price after applying a discount, if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.

## Features

- Calculates the discounted price when the discount is 20% or more
- Returns the original price when the discount is less than 20%
- Handles user input with error checking for numeric values

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment
2. Enter the original price when prompted
3. Enter the discount percentage when prompted
4. The program will display either:
   - The final price after discount (if discount is 20% or higher)
   - The original price (if discount is less than 20%)

## Example Usage
